Starter projects are cloned using

    pinax-admin setup_project

to form the starting point of your own site.

In Pinax 0.9, we are moving towards starter projects having their own
repositories and releases.

A list of external starter projects are available on the Pinax website at:

    http://pinaxproject.com/ecosystem/starter_projects/


We do still provide four foundational starter projects here for now:


zero_project
------------

This project lays the foundation for all other Pinax starter projects. It
provides the project directory layout and some key infrastructure apps on
which the other starter projects are based.


static_project
--------------

This project just serves static media and templates with no models or views.
It is a great starting point for doing HTML mockups while taking advantage of
the Django templating language.


account_project
---------------

This project takes the zero_project and adds basic account management
functionality such as sign up, log in, password change/reset and email
confirmation. It is a foundation suitable for most sites that have user
accounts.


basic_project
-------------

This project takes the account_project and adds profiles and notifications.
It is a foundation suitable for many sites that have user accounts with
profiles.
